								<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As I began my journey only a few short years ago, I only dreamed off making it to this point.  This class is the pinnacle of my degree, the finale.  The work involved within this capstone course and the courses leading to it have pushed me to be a better developer, with more focus on attention to detail especially.  The challenges that I have faced have made me more focused on producing quality code that is both secure and effective.</p>
								<p>Collaboration is one of the most crucial skillsets a developer can have.  While one person can be quite effective, they are only human and will eventually make a mistake.  Errors in code, as many know, can cause any number of issues for a program or system.  Having just two people work together and review each other’s codes is already infinitely more effective than just a singular developer.  Collaboration is one of the most crucial efforts a team of developers can undertake, and should they succeed the benefits are truly wonderful.  One important thing I learned is that collaboration is an effective tool for not only increasing the speed at which your teams can work, but also the quality of the work produced therein.</p>
								<p>If collaboration is the key to developers unlocking their workflow, then communicating with stakeholders is the blueprint for the finished project.  Stakeholders play an integral part into how a project is developed and managed.  The ideas of the stakeholder are simply that, just an idea.  It is your job as the developer to help make those ideas a reality.  Effective communication between developers and stakeholders creates an effective work environment.  You may find yourself having to inform stakeholders than some ideas simply will not work; however, even if an idea won’t work as intended does not mean you cannot offer them new ways to accomplish the same or similar function.  Communication is so important; it gives us a way for everyone to be on the same page.</p>
								<p>Organizing our data is an important step to take regarding code development.  This is where data structures come into play.  Data structures are a way for us to effectively store and retrieve data.  Imagine a filing cabinet without labels.  It is hard to find anything without effective labels or lists to tell you where everything is.  The same is true for data stored in databases.  It must be structured in a manner that it can be stored and retrieved effectively.  For Python, this can be lists and dictionaries, or you can use arrays and objects within JavaScript.  Regardless of the language, utilizing data structures is a crucial part of code development.</p>
								<p>Learning about databases was very enlightening.  The sheer amount of power a database provides to developers is amazing.  Databases store relevant data in a clear and concise manner, all the while allowing full search functionality with filters to help narrow down searches.  Databases provide developers and companies with effective tools to the benefit of all who use them.  One of the most popular databases is MySQL.  This database is an open-source RDBMS used by companies like Facebook and Google.</p>
								<p>Tying all of this together is security.  The security of code, projects, networks, and databases is important.  We want to ensure that these sources of data are protected in a way that only the allows authorized access.  Protecting our code is something I learned very early on in my journey.  Ensuring that you are adhering to secure coding practices, and that you are being vigilant in what you look for in your own code reviews.  Finding bugs and security issues before they become problems is one of the most effective forms of security.  Therefore, as a developer I will always strive to develop secure code. By following best practices, I was able to secure my code enhancements in my various artifacts and ensure that any security issues would be taken cared of prior to final compiling of the projects.</p>
								<p>On my ePortfolio, you will find my code review and three enhancements that highlight key areas of focus for my career.  For my software design and engineering category, I choose to reverse engineer four C++ programs I wrote based on binary files that I converted to assembly from my reverse software engineering course.  It highlights my skill in reverse software engineering in my ability to do a comparison from different blocks of assembly code to better understand the functionalities of the program.  This enhancement shows my ability to go back and forth between languages.  For algorithm and data structures, I choose a project from my secure coding course. I expanded the complexity of the program.  This enhancement highlight’s my ability to look for vulnerabilities and exceptions within a program.  Allowing them to run correctly and notify the end user of errors.  For databases, I used the skills learned in Introduction to SQL.  I created my own database and then created data visualizations using python scripts.  This enhancement highlights my ability to navigate within SQL, to not only read and search using queries, but also to use that data in a python script for data visualization.</p>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>To highlight my proficiency in software design and engineering, I chose an assignment from my CS 410 – Reverse Software Engineering course. The original assignment was completed during Week 4, and the primary objective was to convert four individual binary files into assembly code. Once the files had been converted, using tools, such as Bless Hex Editor, I was to explain the functionality of each file. 
									One of the reasons that I chose this assignment for my ePortfolio, was due to it highlighting the various formats that a source code can be in. In the field of Software Engineering, the ability to reverse engineer source code can be just as important as the ability to write the source code itself. For my planned enhancement of this assignment, I chose to write four individual source codes in C++ that corresponds to each individual binary file. Each of the C++ programs has the functionality determined from each individual binary file. 
									Once I had completed the four source codes, I then added additional functionality to each one, and reversed engineered the programs into both assembly code and binary code. 
								</p>
								<h4>Binary File One</h4>
								<p>The functionality of the first binary file had the program print a generic name and city onto the console, telling the user to ship an item to them. In my enhancement, I added the ability for the user to enter a first and last name, as well as a city. These values entered by the user were then saved to various variables, and then directions to ship were printed on the console, using the information entered by the user. </p>
								<h4>Binary File Two</h4>
								<p>For the second binary file the original functionality was to ask the user to enter their name and then greet the user. In my enhancement, I added the ability for the program to greet the user based on their age. If the age entered is under eighteen, the program lets the user know, that they can not be greeted. If the age is equal to or greater than eighteen, then the programs will greet the user. </p>
								<h4>Binary File Three</h4>
								<p>The original functionality of this binary file was to ask the user to enter two numbers, the program would then add the numbers together and print the sum to the console. In my enhancements of this program, I chose to do a small magic trick in which using math, we can guess the users name. The user first enters the first number of their age and the second number of their age. These values are then saved into individual variables. The program then multiplies that number by five, adds three, doubles it, adds the second number, and subtracts six. Following this these steps, gives us the users age. I also added that the program asks the user if the age is correct, if the user says yes, the program, will then print out a positive message, if the user says no, the program will ask them to try again.</p>
								<h4>Binary File Four</h4>
								<p>The functionality of the final binary file was a program with a Display Menu. The user than had the ability to choose whether they wanted the factorial or summation of a number. In my enhancement, I added two more menu options. They were to determine the square root of a number and the cubic root of a number. Once the user makes their selection, they are asked to enter a number. That value is then saved to a variable, and the mathematical function occurs. </p>
								<h4>Conclusion</h4>
								<p>One of the additional enhancements that I did for this artifact was to do a side by side comparison of the assembly code. When we do a side by side comparison of the assembly code from the original source code to the assembly code generated after the enhancements, we see that the number of registers has increased exponentially. The most common type of register seen is the data registers, under the umbrella of general registers. 
									I was able to complete all my planned enhancements for this artifact. I was able to show how to modify the functionality of existing source code, and reverse engineer the source code to discern different types of information. During completing these enhancements, I learned the importance of outlining your planned modifications ahead of time. I also learned how important it is to keep organized notes during the enhancement process. One of the challenges I faced was remembering to plan the additions I wanted to add ahead of time, so that there would be a less likely chance of an error occurring. Overall, I enjoyed completing the changes to this artifact, as it showed me just how far in my understanding of computer language I have come.

								<p><a href="/ArtifactTwo/Post-Enhancement.zip">Enhanced Files</a></p>
								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>To highlight my proficiency in Algorithms and Data Structures, I chose an assignment from my CS-405. Secure Coding course. The original assignment was completed during Module Four and was all about Exceptions in C++. The premise for the assignment was that I was a senior software developer on a team responsible for a large banking web application. We were informed that there was some code that would terminate abruptly and crash to the desktop without any warnings or information displayed to the user. The suspect code was found, and the decision was made not to change it, but to instead capture the errors in the code and display them appropriately to the user. Therefore, my job was to write the code that would make that possible.	
									The five main tasks that I needed to accomplish were:<ul>
									<li>Create an exception try-block, which will wrap code that can potentially throw exceptional errors</li>
									<li>Catch an exception derived from std::exception</li>
									<li>Catch all unhandled exceptions</li>
									<li>Throw a standard C++ exception</li>
									<li>Create, throw, and catch a custom exception</li>
									</ul>
									The original source code was provided by the professor in a zip file, commented using TODO to the explain the rules I needed to follow to successfully complete the assignment. 
									</p>
									<h4>Pre-Enhancement</h4>
									<p>One of the reasons that I chose this assignment for my ePortfolio was due to the struggle I experienced when originally trying to complete it. While I was able to successfully write the code that was needed in the sections commented with TODO, I was unable to successfully build the program. It would not compile and run, and no changes that I made to correct the program were successful. Therefore, I questioned my ability to handle data structures of any kind. By being able to enhance this assignment and achieve compiling the program and running it, it would show just how far I have come in my understanding of algorithms and data structures.</p>
									<h4>Enhancement</h4>
									<p>My first planned enhancement to this artifact was going to be to successfully compile the program. The error that I would see when I attempted to compile it was “Cannot open include file: crtdbg.h : No such file or directory”. After doing some research on this error, I found that it meant there was a problem with opening the header file. A header file contains definitions of functions and variables that can be imported or used by your C++ program. 
										My second planned enhancement was to better improve my comments in the source code. Part of the original assignment was to comment on the changes made by me to the code. While I did successfully comment in my changes, the comments themselves were generic and did not truly explain what my additions accomplished.
										My final planned enhancement was to add an additional custom exception. The custom exception I am adding, will be more advanced than the ones from the original assignment. By adding a more advanced custom exceptions I will show how my knowledge and understanding of how data structures and algorithms has improved since I originally completed this assignment.
									</p>
									<h4>Post-Enhancement</h4>
									<p>The main functionality of my artifact would not be different once the enhancements were completed, however the program itself would be improved. I was able to correct the error with the header file and successfully compiled the program. Once the program compiled, I was able to run the program and see the different exceptions that I had created being thrown. The inline comments detailing the changes I made to the program were also updated, which was the planned second enhancement. 
										When it came to adding a new custom exception, I decided to include one that would be different from the original exceptions created. In the new custom exception, the program would add a new character to a string until it reached index[10]. Once the program reached the limit set, it would throw an exception and let the user know that the index was out of range. Once added, the program was able to compile, and the new exception could be seen in the console by the user.
									</p>
									<h4>Conclusion</h4>
									<p>Working on this enhancement was a challenge for me, as I saw it as a steppingstone. When I was unable to fully complete the original assignment and get it to compile, I wondered if I would ever be able to complete it in its entirety. I now can say that I have. I learned the importance of paying attention to the small details of a project and realizing that sometimes the error itself does not lie in the source code. Learning to look at a project as a whole and understanding why the compiler, the header files, the code itself, work the way they do together, is part of growing as a software engineer. This artifact helped me to do so, and because of it, I can know that in the future I will be able to solve similar problems that may occur.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Databases</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><a href="/ArtifactThree.zip">Project Files</a></p>
								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>A database is an organized collection of information that is typically stored in a computer system. Databases are used by various organizations daily to store and navigate through thousands of data. When deciding on how to best showcase my proficiency in databases, I focused on my DAD 220 Introduction to SQL course. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is used to communicate with a database, and it is designed to manage that data. </p>
								<h4>Pre-Enhancement</h4>
								<p>
									During the class, we learned how to navigate SQL commands using a sample database that was provided by the instructor. We learned to add data, change data, and run multiple queries to learn more about the data being used. For my planned enhancement, I chose to apply the concepts of SQL that I learned. Using local weather data, I planned to create my own database in SQL. I would import information such as, the daily high and low temperature for the capital city of Louisiana, as well as the high and low humidity percentage for that date. One other piece of data that I chose to incorporate was the precipitation levels in inches for those days as well. 
									The second planned enhancement was to then export the data from the database into a csv file. Once the csv file is created, my plan is to write three separate python scripts for data visualization. The first line plot will show the high and low temperature for each date from September 1 -15, 2021. The second line plot will show the high and low humidity percentages for the same date range. Lastly, the final line plot will show the precipitation for each date in the data. 
								</p>
								<h4>Post-Enhancement</h4>
								<p>The first thing I did when planning to create my database, was to gather local weather data from the capital city of Louisiana. The capital is Baton Rouge, and is very close to where I live, which was why I chose to highlight this weather data. Once I gathered the data for the first half of the month of September, using SQL in the command line, I was able to create my database. Once the database and table were created, I needed to input the weather data I had collected into the database. Once I verified that the data had been successfully added, I was able to export the data into a csv file, that I would then use to write a Python script to create the line plots. Using the weather data that was now in a csv file, I created three individual Python scripts that show three different line plots, with the different data points. The first line plot shows the high and low temperature for the city of Baton Rouge, from September 1-15. The second line plot shows the high and low humidity percentage for the city of Baton Rouge, from September 1-15. The final line plot shows the precipitation for the city of Baton Rouge from September 1-15. </p>
								<h4>Conclusion</h4>
								<p>Data Visualization helps to give us a clear idea of what information in a database means using visual context through graphs as seen above. By applying what I learned in my DAD 220 course, I am confident in my ability to correctly navigate a database using SQL, and to use Python to create visual graphs of said data. </p>
